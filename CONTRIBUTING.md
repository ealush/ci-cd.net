## New scripts
If you have a well crafted script you think others may find useful, this is the place to add it. Try to keep the API similar to existing methods. Short, namespaced names are preferred.

## Documentation
Each script should be accompanied by a markdown description. Describe arguments where applicable. If there's something to visualise with - could be nice.

Preview the docs site on a machine with nodejs installed:
```
npx docpress s
```

Will publish to gh-pages directory and run a watch service (edits are updated automagically!)
